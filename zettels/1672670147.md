| Data Race | 01/02/2023 09:35 |

A **data race** occurrs when two threads/processes (or goroutines) access data 
concurrently, and one of them performs a write. This causes **undefined behavior**.

Go Example:

```go
x := 0
go func(){ x += 2 }()
go func(){ x += 3 }()
```

The result of the above lines could be 2, 3, or 5 depending on when each goroutine
reads/writes the value of `x`.
