Another special kind of function for testing and documentation is the
ExampleFunction. They are defined like so:

```go
func ExampleOperation() {
  fmt.Println(Operation())
  // Out:
  // "Operation Result"
}
```

Example functions illustrate the behavior of some package API. In this case, for
the package containing `Operation()`, spinning up the `godoc` server would include
`ExampleOpeartion()` and the expected output `"Operation Result"` for the public 
func `Operation()` in the resulting documentation. To define a package-level 
example, simply create a function `Example()` (no name/suffix). 

Additionally, when running `go test`, the test runner will verify that `"Operation 
Result"` is printed to stdout for `ExampleOperation()`.
