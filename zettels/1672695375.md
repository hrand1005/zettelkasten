| Serial Confinement | 01/02/2023 16:36 |

The process of passing a single variable between concurrent routines / threads /
processes is sometimes referred to as **serial confinement**. For example, in a 
[pipeline](1671832313.md) a variable is considered confined to one thread until
that stage is finished, after which it may pass the data onto the next thread -- 
the variable falls out of scope in the initial thread. It is especially important 
that the variable is no longer referred to if it is a pointer to prevent 
[data races](1672670147.md).
