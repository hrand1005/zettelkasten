It may be helpful or necessary to represent different levels of a [Software's 
Abstraction](1661219901.md) graphically.

Software Design Tools can create graphical representations of entity relationships,
class hierarchies, higher level architecture diagrams, and use cases. The result is
essentially some graphic that could be created with pen and paper, but they often 
are created using formal notations to represent relationships (UML), and are thus checked
for consistency automatically, and some tools may do automatic housekeeping when 
entities are removed.
