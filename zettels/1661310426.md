Managing the cognitive complexity of your tasks plays an important role in accomplishing
your particular goal (such is the power of [abstraction](1661219901.md), but narrowing 
your focus is a double edged sword which trades perspective for specific efficiencies.

In pair programming, two programmers work towards a common goal, but their roles
are distinct: one is the "driver" and the other is there to review. The driver is
(by comparison) is narrowly focused on implementation details, while the reviewer can
remain in a "higher-level" headspace suitable for catching high-level errors that might 
go unnoticed by the driver. 

Likewise, a business may have multiple departments working towards a common goal, for 
example a CEO and a CTO, or Product Manager and Engineer. Their distinct priorities create
a unique value proposition much like pair programming: each subject is able to prevent the 
other from being entrenched in the narrow scope of their own task while still collaborating
to achieve a common goal. All the better if each subject has at least a surface-level 
understanding of the other's priorities and thus able to engage in discussion.
