| Go Reflection Drawbacks | 03/28/2023 22:50 |

The Go authors urge caution using the [reflect package](1679148079.md) for the
following reasons:

1. **Fragility** - using the reflect package may make your code fragile because by
their nature errors will tend to be caught at run time instead of compile time. 
Compiler errors and tooling will also be less effective in creating a robust 
program.

2. **Readability** - due to the lack of typing, code using the reflect package 
(e.g. `reflect.Value` types instead of go primitives) is hard to read, and less
self-documenting. 

3. **Performance** - the compiler cannot optimize for
[`reflect.Value`](1680056856.md) and thus using the reflection package may
cause your code to be one to two orders of magnitude slower than an equivalent
implementation that optimizes for a single type.
