[Layout and style of the code itself](1663016705.md) is important for collaborative efforts wherein 
many developers will have to read your code. The layout comments and documentation, too, 
should be considered, as they will also be read by your teammates.

"The Book Paradigm", developed by Paul Oman and Curtis Cook, offers formatting style
for code documentation intended to organize both high-level and low-level documentation
of a project's code. The paradigm uses the following sections:

**Preface**: Introductory comments at the top of a file.

**Table of Contents**: a list or chart of classes and relations contained in the project.

**Sections**: divisions within routines for more low-level comments.

**Cross-References**: references to related project code, perhaps including a line number.
