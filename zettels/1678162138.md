| Go Private Var Fakes | 03/06/2023 23:08 |

The Go authors suggest using private variables as a means of faking out certain
functionality in **white box testing**. For example:

```go

var subroutine = func() string { return "result" }

func routine() {
  if subroutine == "result" {
    // do something
    return
  }
  // do something else
  return
}
```

The variable `subroutine` may be assigned alternate values during testing like so,
saving the initial value of the variable to revert the state after a test is 
performed:

```go
func TestRoutine(t *testing.T) {
  savedFunc := subroutine
  subroutine = func() string { return "testResult" }
  defer func() { subroutine = savedFunc }
  // ... perform testing
}
```

The simplicity of this approach should be weighed against the disadvantages 
compared to dependency injection via fake pointer-receivers or arguments (this is
the type of faking/mocking I'm more familiar with in Go testing). Some cons
include the inability to parallelize testing, and of course the risks associated
with "global data" (the possibility to modify this variable, even if it is just
exposed at the package level).
