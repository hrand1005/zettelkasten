| Design with Capabilities, not Data | 10/15/2023 19:06 |

In designing a service, it's more useful to consider the capabilities ofered by
a bounded context to the rest of the organization, not just the data it contains.
Sam Newman argues this leads to a better modeling of services.

"...thinking about _data_ leads to anemic, CRUD-based ... services."

"...capabilities become the key operations that will
be exposed over the wire to other collaborators."

(Chapter 3, Section **Business Capabilities**)
