| Kinds of Comments | 09/14/2022 08:26 |

McConnell says there are three kinds of comments permissable in production code:
comments of intent, summaries, and comments that describe things that cannot possibly
be described in the code such as licenses, copyrights, confidentiality agreements etc.

Other kinds of comments, like comment repeating the code and comments explaining the 
code, are better addressed by improving the code readability and removing the comment.

Marker (or TODO) comments are acceptable during development.
