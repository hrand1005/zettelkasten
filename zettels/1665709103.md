Brooks' analysis of the essence of software engineering (construction) in 
"No Silver Bullet" makes some distinctions between essential and accidental 
obstacles in software development not elaborated in McConnell's description 
of ["Programmer" in _Code Complete_](1662733779.md).

**Essential tasks** are abstract problems inherent to software development for
which there are no "silver bullets". These tasks include dealing with or 
defining data sets, relations of data, algorithms, and invocations of functions.

**Accidental tasks** are difficulties that arise in day to day production but are
not inherent to software, for example, representing a software entity in any
particular technology or tool.
