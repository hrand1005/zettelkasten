You can add the `--race` flag to `go build`, `go run`, and `go test`, and the 
go runtime will check for [data races](1672670147.md). It accomplishes this by 
checking for concurrent reads / writes to shared variables, accounting for 
synchronization mechanisms. If races are detected, they will be printed to stdout
in a stack trace showing the reading / writing goroutine.
