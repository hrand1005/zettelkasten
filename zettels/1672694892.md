| Go Montior Goroutines | 01/02/2023 16:28 |

A goroutine which "brokers" access to confined variable via channels is called
a **monitor goroutine**. The monitor goroutine will update the confined variable
in accordance with [channel communication](1671647418.md). Since the goroutine has sole access
to the variable, and only receives requests to update its data through channel 
communications, this prevents [data races](1672670147.md).
