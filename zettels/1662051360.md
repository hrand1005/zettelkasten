*Continuous integration* (CI) is a form of [incremental integration](1661984656.md) wherein developers 
continuously commit code changes to one shared repository. The consensus on "continuous" seems 
to mean that the code is integrated (and validated) at least once per day.

It's common to automate the process of validating the newly (frequently) integrated code. For example,
many CI tools support automatically triggering new build/test jobs each time a commit is made to
some repository. This automated process is known as a *Pipeline* or a *CI Pipeline*. 

*Pipelines* may be extended to do more than just validate the code in processes such as [*Continuous Delivery*
and *Continuous Deployment*](1662051924.md).
