| Constancy in Change Itself | 09/28/2022 01:30 |

That you should ["plan to throw one away"](1664251484.md) is merely one consequence
stemming from Brook's assertion that "the only constancy is change itself". 

Two more conclusions are that 1) software systems should be built to change with 
modular designs, high level languages and readable code, as well as versions/
releases, and 2) organizations should be built to change such that seasoned engineers
can be flexible, fulfilling the role of manager or engineer when required. To 
keep the organization flexible, there should be regular rotations so that skills
in disparate areas remain sharp.

The organization recommendation is based on real software organizations like IBM, but
Brooks once again mentions his idea of ["the surgical team"](1662229632.md), which may
also achieve flexibility in the unit of a team with a chief engineer -- but since that 
is the smallest unit that would need to be moved around in an organization, engineers 
would stay in an engineering (not managerial) role.
