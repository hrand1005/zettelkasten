| Go Interpreting Profiling Results | 03/13/2023 17:30 |

There are a number of ways to interpret [profiling results](1678726841.md); a 
simple method is described in the go book using `go tool pprof`. After running a
profile (e.g. `go test -cpuprofile=cpu.out -run=NONE -bench=<BENCH> <PACKAGE>`),
the `go test` tool will keep the test executable as `<executable>.test`. You may
provide this executable to the `pprof` tool to interpret the profiling results
like so:

```
go tool pprof -text -nodecount=<rows> ./<exec>.test cpu.out
```

`-nodecount` sets the number of rows to be printed to stdout, they will be ordered
from most to least significant for the created profile.
