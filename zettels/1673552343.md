**RWMutexes** are more sophisticated mechanisms for enforcing mutual exclusion and
preventing [data races](1672670147.md).

A **RWMutex**, also sometimes called _multiple readers, single writer lock_ is 
used to enforce a kind of mutual exclusion such that multiple threads can read
a resource concurrently, but only one write Lock exists, and forces mutual exclusion. In Go this is implemented by still having the `Lock()` method from `sync.Mutex`,
but the `sync.RWMutex` also has `RLock()` and `RUnlock()` methods.
