One of the biggest obstacles to code reusability, according to Brooks, is that
it can be difficult to find and understand a module if it is complex. Brooks 
likens learning modules to learning language, and makes [documentation 
recommendations](1665457120.md) that I find compelling:

- _"People learn in sentence contexts, so we need to publish many examples of 
composed products, not just libraries of parts"_
- _"People do not memorize anything but spelling. They learn syntax and semantics
incrementally, in context, by use."_
- _"People group word composition rules by syntactic classes, not compatible 
subsets of objects."_

My experience corroborates this -- I have the best time consuming documentation
for code libraries when examples are provided in addition to API. One example
is the [youtube api](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/code_samples/go)
that I used in [mcsweeney](https://github.com/hrand1005/mcsweeney).
