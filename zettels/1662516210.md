Brooks suggests Multiple Implementations of an architectural specification may
lend authority to architectural decisions / specifications, an important matter
for [software organizations where architecture is a foremost consideration separate
from those who implement the specifications](1662391961.md).

I theorize that the necessity to be compatible with multiple implementations may
be both a guiding force for architectural specifications and a clarification of the
system requirements. The practice of refining architectural specifications to their
generalizeable qualities (for multiple implementations) may improve the extensibility
of a design.
