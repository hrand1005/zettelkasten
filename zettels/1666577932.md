| Go Method-Function conversion | 10/23/2022 22:18 |

In Go it's possible to convert a method to a function such that the method's 
receiver becomes the function's first parameter. E.g.

```Go
type Rect struct {
  length int
  width int
}

func (r *Rect) Area() int {
  return r.length * r.width
}

func main() {
  // create a function out of a method
  rectangleArea := (*Rect).Area

  // what would have been the receiver is now a param
  area := rectangleArea(&Rect{
    length: 5,
    width: 10,
  })

  fmt.Printf("Area: %v\n", area)
}
```

It's hard to say where exactly this is "good practice", but it could in theory
be a more readable alternative to [using a nil receiver](1666441916.md)t .
