In "The Other Face", Brooks describes documentation for different kinds of 
users. The three users (or use cases) are (and require documents) as follows:

1. "The casual user" (to use a program)

  - Requires documentation of the program's purpose, environment, operating 
  instructions, options (configurations), and some pre-post conditions of 
  running the program such as input domain and format as well as accuracy of 
  output. 

2. "The user who must depend on a program" (to believe a program)

  - Mainline tests (nominal/expected test cases), and valid and invalid test cases
  for edge cases of the system. 

3. "The user who must adapt a program for changes in circumstance or purpose" 
(to modify a program) -- I take this to mean to develop a program.

  - More in-depth documents describing file layout, flowcharts and diagrams, 
  algorithm references, author discussions and suggestions for future modification

This approach defines different kinds of documentation that may need to be required,
but not all proposals for document layout distinguish between these users explicitly.
One comparison is the [Book Paradigm](1663510511.md) mentioned in 
_Code Complete, 2nd Edition_. I was under the impression that this paradigm is chiefly
for other developers, although it may not be so limited.
