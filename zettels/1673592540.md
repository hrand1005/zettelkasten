In addition to preventing [data races](1672670147.md), synchronization primitives
play an important role in _memory synchronization_. It's possible for different
goroutines to have their own local memory caches / resources. For certain CPUs
it's possible that separate goroutines could read from the same variable but get
different results depending on when this cache was last refreshed.
