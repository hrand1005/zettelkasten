| Go Interface Comparisons | 11/14/2022 21:21 |

Two go interface values are equal if they are both `nil` or if both of their
[dynamic types and dynamic values](1668477467.md) are equal, the latter being 
comparable with the `==` operator. 

Since not all dynamic values are so comparable, some interface comparisons are
valid and others may cause a runtime error:

```go
var x interface{} = 1
fmt.Println(x == x) // true

var y interface{} = []int{1, 2}
fmt.Println(y == y) // panics!
```

See a working example [here](https://github.com/hrand1005/go-sandbox/tree/master/interface_comparisons).
