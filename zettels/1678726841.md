| Go Profiling | 03/13/2023 13:00 |

The `go test` tool supports several kinds of profiling: 

**CPU Profile**: identifies functions that take the longest time to execute. 

**HEAP Profile**: identifies statements that cause the greatest memory allocations.

**BLOCKING Profile**: identifies statements that block goroutines for the longest
period of time, e.g. syscalls, sends/receives on channels etc.

These profiles can be enabled during `go test` like so:

```
go test -cpuprofile=cpu.out <test regex>
go test -memprofile=mem.out <test regex>
go test -blockprofile=block.out <test regex>
```

Typically, you'd run these profiles for [benchmarks](1678475741.md), e.g:
```
go test -run=NONE -bench=<BENCHMARK TEST NAME> -cpuprofile=cpu.out <PACKAGE NAME>
```

Each type of profiling can also be invoked in non-test code using the `runtime`
package API.
