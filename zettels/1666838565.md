| Go Interfaces Assignable | 10/26/2022 22:42 |

Go Interfaces are not only implicitly satisfied types, they can also be declared
as variables and assigned. This isn't a pattern I commonly see, but it's possible:

```Go
type Bee struct{}

func (b Bee) String() string {
  return `I'm a bee!`
}

func main() {
  var s fmt.Stringer
  s = Bee{}

  fmt.Println(s)
}
```

Result:
```
I'm a bee!
```
