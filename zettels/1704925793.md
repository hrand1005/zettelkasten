| Orchestration vs Choreography | 01/10/2024 14:29 |

Orchestration and Choreography are two contrasting architectural styles for
microservices.

**Orchestration** is an architecture wherein a single process governs the
interactions between services. In other words, there is a central authority
governing interactions between microservices. Integrated microservices usually
notify and communicate only with the orchestrator.

**Choreography** contrasts orchestration, there is no central authority
controlling interactions between services. Each microservice must be designed
to understand its role in communicating and coordinating with other
microservices. Choreographed microservices must therefore also know whom to
notify and communicate with.

| Style         | Pros                                                     | Cons                                                                                       |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Orchestration | + Easiy monitoring <br>+ Explicit Control                | - Services can be 'anemic' <br>- Lots of logic in one place, high coupling to orchestrator |
| Choreography  | + Services not anemic <br>+ Services loosely coupled (?) | - Additional work to monitor services <br>- Decentralized logic can be hard to understand  |
