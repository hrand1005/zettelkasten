| Project Size and Time Allocation | 08/25/2022 21:40 |

As software projects grow in size (as measured by lines of code, for example) the 
proportion of time allocated to various engineering activities may need to change.
While time required for construction may scale linearly with the lines of code in 
a project, time needed for requirements, architecture, testing and debugging, and 
communication scales up more quickly. The most cost effective allocation of time
and effort therefore depends on the size of your software project.
