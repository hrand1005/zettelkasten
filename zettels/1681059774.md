You may interact directly with the Linux system through the Console Terminal,
which provides access to the shell without relying on graphical interfaces /
desktop environments. Also called virtual console terminals (instances of the
shell), they are commonly accessible with `Ctrl+Alt` plus `F1 - F7`, where either
`F1` or `F7` are reserved for returning to the default graphical desktop
environment.
