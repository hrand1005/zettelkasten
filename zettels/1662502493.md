Another way in which engineers/architects may become overly optimistic about their
projects is exhibited by the [**Second System Effect**](1661826332.md).

Brooks defines the **Second System Effect** as the tendency of systems architects
to embellish their second go at a project with the features/functions that they 
tabled in their first. The rationale is that architects are reserved in their first
iteration, overly ambitious to include their untried ideas in the second system, and
then from the third project onward have a better grasp over what experience they have
is generally applicable to building systems and which learnings/practices were particular
to the specifics of their accomplished projects.

The restraint of architects and designers must be of great importance for the success of a 
projects organized where [implementors depend on practical specifications provided by 
architects](1662391961.md).
