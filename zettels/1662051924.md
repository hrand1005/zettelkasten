After builds are tested/validated in a [CI process](1662051360.md), the new artifacts
or builds may need to be saved for future deployment. *Continuous Delivery* refers to
the saving of these newly updated artifacts, builds, or systems for future deployment
through manual processes. Contrastingly, *Continuous Deployment* refers to a process
which deploys new builds to production automatically after they have been validated and
saved.
