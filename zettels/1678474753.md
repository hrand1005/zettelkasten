| Go Cover Tool | 03/10/2023 13:59 |

The cover [tool](1678474059.md) can be used to determine the `statement coverage`
of go tests. It can be invoked in various ways:

`go test -cover <test regex, e.g. ./...>` simply adds percentage of tests covered
to the test report in stdout. 

`go test -coverprofile=c.out <test_regex>` creates an html coverage report to
`c.out`. It can be opened in the browser with the cover tool with `go tool cover -html=c.out`.

By default, the cover tool merely indicates whether each statement is executed, but
by using the `-covermode=count` flag, (e.g. 
`go test -covermode=count -coverprofile=c.out <test_regex>`, the number of times 
each statement is exercised is reported.
