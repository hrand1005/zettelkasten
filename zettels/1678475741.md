Go benchmarks can be defined similarly to typical unit tests:

```go
func BenchmarkName(b *testing.B) {
  for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
    // some operation
  }
}
```

To invoke the benchmark, the `-bench` flag must be set explicitly: 
```go
go test -bench=<test regex>
```

In addition to printing normal test results to stdout, benchmarks will also be 
printed. Each benchmark test will have an integer suffix representing `$GOMAXPROCS`,
the number of operations, and time per operation (e.g. `500ns/op`). 

Additionally, the `-benchmem` flag can be used to print out memory used and the
number of new allocations at runtime, (e.g. `304B/op 4allocs/op`).
