| Go Internal Package | 02/24/2023 22:01 |

`internal` has a special meaning in import paths -- this keyword restricts access
of nested packages to packages sharing the parent of `internal`. Take the 
following packages, for example:

```
net/http/internal/chunked
net/http/httputil
net/url
```

Package `chunked` is accessible by `http` and `httputil`, but not `url`. 
Of course, `url` may access the api of `http` and `httputil`.
