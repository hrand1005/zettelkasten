| Go Simple Cancel | 12/30/2022 21:46 |

One simple way to implement "cancels" using channels is to create a function 
`canceled()`, which checks a `done` channel for a received value to determine
if a cancel has occurred. Since receiving on a closed channel always yields a 
zero-value, this example's `done` case will always execute:
