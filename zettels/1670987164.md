| Go Discriminated Unions | 12/13/2022 22:06 |

While it's common to use Go interfaces for their methods, they may also function 
as **discriminated unions**, or a way to store heterogeneous data. Interface values
can represent a multitude of concrete types, and their types can be asserted to
elicit different kinds of behavior. Notably the switch statement enables the
execution of different cases depending on an interface's asserted type:

```go
switch x.(type) {
case int: 
  ...
case string:
  ...
}
```

It's also possible to declare a variable to hold the value of the concrete type
that's scoped to the switch statement like so:

```go
switch val := x.(type) {
case int:
  val++
case error:
  msg += val.Error()
...  
}
```

The empty interface `interface{}` is a useful type for discriminated unions because
there are no restrictions on the underlying [dynamic type](1668477467.md) (concrete type).
