| Class-Adapter Design Pattern | 08/26/2022 13:58 |

My coworkers and I informally call what _Design Patterns_ catalogued as the 
Adapter pattern a "wrapper". However, this is fitting because we write code in
Go, which only permits the object-adapter implementation, and not an implementation
of the pattern using inheritance. The Class Adapter pattern example in _Design Patterns_
inherits the public interface it's adapting to, and the private implementation of the 
adaptee:
  
  ```
  class Adapter: public AdaptedInterface, private Adaptee
  ```

Although this adapter implementation is considered less flexible than the object-adapter,
which stores a reference to the adaptee and could work with other adaptees of the same interface
(such as subclasses), I was charmed by the multiple inheritance class-adapter because it requires 
so little new code.
