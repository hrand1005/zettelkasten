| C Compilation System | 10/15/2023 18:45 |

The **compilation system** is made up of multiple components / stages. GCC 
(compiling C) uses the following stages: 

1. Preprocessor (C Text File, e.g. ASCII  -> C Text File)
2. Compiler (C Text File -> Assembly Text File)
3. Assembler (Assembly Text File -> Object Binary File)
4. Linker (Object Binary File -> Executable Binary File)
