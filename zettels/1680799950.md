| Go Invoking C Libraries | 04/06/2023 12:52 |

The `cgo` tool makes it possible to call c code in Go programs. The Go package
calling c libraries might be structured as follows:

```go
package <name>

/*
#cgo CFLAGS: <flags>
#cgo DFLAGS: <flags>
#include <somelib.h>

int some_function(int x);
*/

import "C"

//...
```

The `import "C"` statement is special, and causes the `go build` tool to 
preprocess the preceding c comment before compiling the rest of the go code.
`int some_function(int x);` can be accessed now through the C package:

```go
x := C.some_function(5)
```
