| Go Method Receivers | 10/22/2022 08:31 |

[Like maps](1666531549.md), Go method calls also trade explicitness for 
robustness (specifically preventing panics). 
The Go compiler can implicilty understand method calls' receivers as either 
pointers or non-pointers (values) depending on the type demanded by the method.
For example, both of the following compile:

```Go
type Dog struct {
  Name string
  Breed string
}

// Note value-receiver
func (d Dog) Greet() {
  fmt.Printf("Who's a good boy, %s?", d.Name)
}


type Person struct {
  Firstname string
  Lastname string
}

// Note pointer-receiver
func (p *Person) Greet() {
  fmt.Printf("Salutations, %s %s", p.Firstname, p.Lastname)
}


func main() {
  // Example 1: pointer object can call value-receiver method
  fido := &Dog{
    Name: "Fido",
    Breed: "German Shepherd"
  }

  fido.Greet()

  // Example 2: value object can call pointer-receiver method
  maxine := Person{
    Firstname: "Maxine",
    Lastname: "Rand"
  }

  maxine.Greet()
}

```

However, Donovan and Kernighan advise that you do not copy objects that use 
pointer-receiver methods, because this may violate "internal invariants" which
may lead to undefined behavior. They cite bytes.Buffer, which, if copied, 
creates an alias for objects representing the same underlying memory, so multiple
methods called on one alias will affect the other.
