| Go sync.Once | 01/15/2023 22:52 |

Protecting the initialization of shared variables, even if they're just readonly,
can be an important measure for [memory synchronization](1673592540.md) -- i.e.
in the absence of a synchronization mechanism not all goroutines necessarily will
hold the most up-to-date version of variables in their local caches / registers.

`sync.Once` types can be used to initialize variables exactly once in a
concurrency safe way. The `sync.Once` type has a single `Do()` method that
accepts a function and will execute it if and only if it has not already been
performed.

```go
type loadHerbMap sync.Once

func HerbMapGet(key string) string {
    loadHerbMap.Do(initHerbMap)
    return herbMap[key]
}
```
