I think _Code Complete_ and _The Pragmatic Programmer_ each identify  one [incremental integration
methodology](1661984656.md) by different names; _Code Complete_ calls it 'T-shaped integration' and 
_The Pragmatic Programmer_ calls it 'tracer bullet'. 

The strategy involves prioritizing the implementation of one use case from end to end in a project (although _Code Complete_'s
'T-shaped integration' also says the defining of high-level interfaces is required). This first implementation has several 
benefits: it clarifies designs for each software layer of the system, it provides immediate feedback about the 
workability of the design, it provides visibility of the system to the developers and stakeholders (and visible progress may
boost morale), and it acts as a skeleton for future incremental integration. 

I've employed tracer bullets in my own personal software projects with success.
