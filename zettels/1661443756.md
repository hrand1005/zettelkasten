[Abstraction](1661219901.md) is useful for managing cognitive complexity while coding, but
it hides the inner mechanisms of an abstract concept to accomplish this. Sometimes it might
be necessary to expose the inner mechanisms so that they can be finely tuned for performance.

However, it should be noted that this comes at a great cost to the code's readability and maintainability,
so all changes of this nature should have their performance benefit strictly measured/profiled,
accounting for all manner of variables such as compiler, environment, hardware, etc. This point
is emphasized repeatedly in the experiments from Code Complete Chapter 26, wherein seemingly
logical code changes with the intention of improving perforance can produce unexpected results.
