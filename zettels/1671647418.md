| Go Channel Operations | 12/21/2022 13:30 |

There are three operations that can be performed on a channel type.

**Receive:** 
```go
x := <- ch // stores received value in x
<- ch // ignores received value
```

**Send:**
```go
ch <- x // sends value of x to channel
```

The above operations are collectively known as **communiciations**. 

**Close:**
```go
close(ch)
```

A close operation yields all buffered values to the receiver before sending a
zero value for the channel type. Subsequent sends on a closed channel will cause
a panic. To differentiate between valid zero-values and zero-values sent due to
a closed channel you can receive the secondary boolean return value:
```go
val, ok := <- ch
```
