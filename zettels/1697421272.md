**Endian-ness** refers to how bytes are ordered.

Consider the hexadecimal representation of 0x0123

-   **Little endian** orders bytes from least to most significant in memory. Example:

| Addr | 0x100 | 0x101 |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Val  | 01    | 23    |

-   **Big endian** orders bytes from most to least significant in memory.

| Addr | 0x100 | 0x101 |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Val  | 23    | 01    |
