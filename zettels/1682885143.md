| getchar() int return | 04/30/2023 16:05 |

The `stdio.h` function `getchar()` returns a `char` read from stdin. However, it's best practice to assign the result to an `int`. This is because when the
end of the stdin stream is encountered, `getchar()` returns `EOF`, a symbolic 
constant (macro) of `-1`. The result of `getchar()` must be assigned to an `int` 
to check for this special case. `EOF` cannot be a `char` (or some other 
type represented by equal / fewer bits) because then some valid input would
collide with this special return value.
