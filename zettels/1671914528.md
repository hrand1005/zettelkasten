| Go Unidirectional Channels | 12/24/2022 15:42 |

[Bidirectional channels](1671647418.md) can be converted to **unidirectional**
channels, but not vice versa. This is especially common in [passing channels as
args](1671832313.md) to functions, which commonly send or receive to the channel
only.

Receive-Only Channel:
```
<-ch int
```

Send-Only Channel
```
ch<- int
```

Closing on a receive-only channel causes a panic.
