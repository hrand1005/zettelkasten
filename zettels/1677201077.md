The GOOS and GOARCH environment variables specify the OS and architecture for 
which go programs will be compiled. They can be accessed in a go program via the 
"runtime" package (e.g. `runtime.GOOS`, `runtime.GOARCH`). 

It's also possible to specify build constraints via build tags, which contain
some expression defining the conditions under which a file should be compiled.

Before 1.18:
```go
// +build darwin amd64
// +build ignore
```

After 1.18:
```go
//go:build (linux && arm64) || (darwin && amd64)
//go:build exclude
```
