| Go Counting Semaphores | 12/27/2022 09:46 |

A "counting semaphore" is a construct that can be implemented using buffered
channels to limit concurrent operations. Declare a buffered channel with capacity
_n_. For the limited operation, require that the channel have a value sent to it
immediately before the operation, and receive a value on the channel after the 
operation. This will ensure that no more than _n_ operations occur concurrently.

e.g.
```go
ch := make(chan struct{}, 20)

ch <- struct{} // before operation
operation()
<- ch // after operation
```

The line `ch <- struct{}` will block if the channel is full, i.e. if 20 goroutines
are already performing `operation()`. The following line `<- ch` releases the
goroutine's position in the channel, allowing other goroutines that may be blocked
to proceed.
