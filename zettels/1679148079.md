| Go Reflection | 03/18/2023 10:01 |

**Reflection** is the mechanism by which the go runtime can interact with variables
(determine/assign values, call methods, determine type) at runtime. In other words,
reflection allows the Go runtime to interact with variables without knowing their
types at compile time.
