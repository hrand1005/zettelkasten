One aspect of development that can be especially tricky with large projects
(especially [programming systems](1661523680.md), which have a multitude of components) is integration.

_Code Complete_ describes two types of integration: phased and incremental. 

**Phased Integration** describes an approach wherein separate software modules are developed and tested
separately, and then 'integrated' and tested only after they are completely developed. The phase at which
a complete module is integrated is sometimes called "Big Bang" integration (also called this in _The Pragmatic Programmer_)
because the entire project may be expected to come together all at once.

**Incremental Integration** describes an approach wherein software is integrated into the system as it's being developed.
This practice necessarily involves integrating incomplete modules into the main project, and to test high level 
interfaces it is therefore sometimes necessary to stub or mock out functionality that is not yet developed. 

Incremental Integration might observe slower development of new modules early on (as each new unit of work must be integrated,
and sometimes other functionality requires stubbing/mocking), but the advantages are immediate feedback and visibility into
the progress of a system's development. 

There are many flavors of incremental integration, such as [tracer bullets aka T-shaped integration](1661985707.md).
