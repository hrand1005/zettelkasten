| Go Unbuffered Channels | 12/22/2022 17:46 |

Unbuffered channels are able to make the guarantees about the [timing of certain 
operations](1671647418.md). Specifically, they can guarantee that a receive operation 
in the receiving goroutine will complete after the send operation in 
the sending goroutine. In other words, where these sends and receives occur, the
goroutines are "syncrhonized". 

For this reason, unbuffered channels are sometimes referred to as **synchronous 
channels**. 

When unbuffered channel operations are used primarily to aid in synchronizing 
channels, rather than sharing their data, their send/receive operations are 
sometimes called **events**. For situations where the data-type sent over the
channel is irrelevant, it's conventional to use an empty struct:
```go
ch <-struct{}{}
```
