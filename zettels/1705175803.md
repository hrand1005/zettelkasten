Two main strategies are described to achieve **Replication**:

**Replicated State Machine (RSM)**: Servers transfer instructions between one
another, each applying instructions in turn. Assumes the results of performing
instructions is deterministic.

**State Transfer**: Servers transfer state between one another.

RSM relies on deterministic results of applying instructions, while state
transfer can be expensive for systems that operate on a lot of state/data. In
practice, hybrid approaches (e.g. using checkpointing) are often used.
