The [`unsafe` package's](1680743763.md) `unsafe.Pointer` type is useful for
performing pointer arithmetic. It enables `uintptr`s to be converted to an address
permitting arithmetic operations, and then back into a `uintptr` again. It's worth
noting that `uintptr`s shouldn't be used to represent currently addressed
variables, because they can become out of date through certain kinds of garbage
collection (moving GCs, although they're not currently used in the Go runtime) or
growing goroutine stacks. 

Applying `unsafe.Pointer` might look like this:

```go
var x struct {
  a bool
  b int16
  c []int
}

// equivalent to pb := &x.b
pb := (*int16)(unsafe.Pointer(
      uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&x)) + unsafe.Offsetof(x.b)))
*pb = 42

fmt.Println(x.b) // 42
```
