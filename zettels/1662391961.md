Frederick Brooks Jr. proposes another way to organize software teams in the chapter
_Aristocracy, Democracy, and System Design_. Unlike ["The Surgical Team"](1662229632.md),
which scales with many teams with the same composition, a Vertical division of labor 
separates each team by responsibility, with roughly three main categories: Architecture, 
Implementation, and Realization. To understand how the work is passed from team to team, 
you must understand Brooks' definition of architecture:

**Architecture** is the "complete and detailed specification of the user interface." Citing
Blaauw: "Where architecture tells _what_ happens, implementation tells _how_ it is made to 
happen." 

By delegating architectural responsibilities to one person or small teams, Brooks argues the
conceptual integrity of a system can be maintained. Architects define specifications, pass them
to implementors, and implementors build within the conceptual constraints of the system. 

Again, there is limited data to support this proposed structure by Brooks, other than his singluar
personal experience wherein sharing the responsibility of architectural work to a large number of
implementors resulted in a late project with poor conceptual integrity. 

Brooks considers ["conceptual integrity" to be the most important aspect of system design.](1662390460.md)
