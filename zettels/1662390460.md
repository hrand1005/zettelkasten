Frederick Brooks Jr. contends that the most important consideration in the [design
of a system](1661523680.md) is **Conceptual Integrity**. Although Brooks admits that
a single (or small set of architects) taking a more hands-off approach in delegating
architectural work to implementors might enable teams to develop a more feature-rich 
(Brooks says 'function' instead of 'feature') system, there is a price paid in simplicity
and straightforwardness. In other words, the cost is "ease of use". A logical conclusion 
of Brooks' arguent is that he values ease of use over function, or at least he values
ease of use over any function that may be gained through the diverse achitectural 
ideas gained through the input of many engineers. 

This contention is not apparently considerate of any empirical data-- the conceptual 
integrity is not something that seems measurable, and valuing ease of use over features
is not apparently supported by data (e.g. sales figures, development cost/time etc.).
