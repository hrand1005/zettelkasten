The opposite of [**white box testing**](1678162138.md) is **black box testing**,
which aims to test package APIs, and by design is not concerned with the internals
(implementation) of a package.

External test packages can be used when multiple packages need to be imported for
testing, e.g. for integration testing. By adding the *_test.go suffix to a package
name, it will be recognized by the `go test` tool as a package that needs to be 
compiled just for testing.
