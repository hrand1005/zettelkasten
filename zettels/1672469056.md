| Go Checking for Goroutine Leaks | 12/31/2022 01:44 |

A simple way to check for [goroutine leaks](1672023529.md) is to force a panic
at the end of a program's execution. A program with all its goroutines properly
closed will show a stack-trace of the main goroutine only -- all outstanding 
goroutines  appear in the stack-trace.
