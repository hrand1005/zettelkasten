Brooks asserts that, for large software systems, the first build will be 
"barely usable". The first iteration exposes design flaws that must be addressed
in a redesign, which can happen either incrementally, or all at once. The 
rationale is perfectly summed up by Brooks' quote: 

"plan to throw one away, you will anyhow"

I personally have found redesigns to be necessary and effective, even on my own
small projects. However, I don't have any data or reasoning to indicate that 
this must necessarily be the case.
