Brooks describes several properties of ["Essential Software Tasks"](1665709103.md):

**Complexity** - Software construction is inherently complex because newly defined
functions must be unique. Proof by contradiction: if they weren't unique, they 
would be one subroutine.

**Changeability** - Software functionality is determined by user demands and the 
host platforms, and must be changed over time to accommodate them. 

**Invisibility** - Unlike geometric diagrams and schematics in other engineering 
disciplines, software is "invisible" because it cannot be fully and faithfully 
represented visually in such a way. 

I think on this last point that Brooks would agree that diagrams are still sometimes
useful visual aids in coming to understand a system -- he simply means to say that
the essence of software cannot be captured to the same extent as a building's floor
plan using a diagram or chart. However, I'd like to point out that even those diagrams
are abstracted to some degree.
