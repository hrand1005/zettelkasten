**DNS** stands for domain name system. DNS translates domain names to remote IP 
address of the associated server. There is a hierarchy to DNS servers -- starting
with the root server, each server resolves some part of the requested domain.
For example, if you type 'google.com' into your browser, it may need to be resolved
to an IP address using DNS. Firstly, the domain name would be routed to the
Root DNS server, which is at the top of the DNS hierarchy. This server would then
point to the TLD (Top Level Domain) server, which can resolve the '.com' suffix.
Having resolved this part of the domain name, the TLD server would next point to
the Authoritative DNS server, which is the final stop in resolving the domain to
an IP address.

It's worth noting that when you make the HTTP request for a domain, the matching
IP Address may be cached in a number of places, from the browser, to the client 
machine's OS, to the ISP's resolver, a proxy, or at any level of the DNS hierarchy.
