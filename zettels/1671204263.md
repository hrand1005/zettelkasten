The Go Book's chapter on interfaces ends with two short words of advice:

1. Don't use interfaces unless multiple concrete types implement them.

2. Keep interfaces short -- one or two methods -- this makes the type valuable
and simple.

One exception to 1. is that interfaces might be helpful in decoupling packages --
declaring an interface in one package separate from the dependencies of the 
implemented 'concrete' type could be useful in some situtaions.
