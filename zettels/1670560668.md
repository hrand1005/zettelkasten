| Go Type Assertions | 12/08/2022 23:37 |

Type assertions may be applied to interface values. To assert an interface to a
type, its [dynamic type/value](1668477467.md) must be compatible with the asserted interface. 
Being asserted to an incompatible interface type, including asserting nil to 
some interface type, causes a panic. However, using the second-value assignment with
ok prevents this panic from occurring, and the second bool (ok) indicates whether
the assertion succeeded.

```go
var w io.Writer
b, ok := w.(*bytes.Buffer)
```

Interface values may be type asserted to other interface values, or their concrete
dynamic types.
