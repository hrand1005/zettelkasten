In an attempt to tackle [projects of large sizes](1661523680.md), Frederick Brooks Jr. 
proposes (or references a previously proposed) _The Surgical Team_. 

The team is comprised of ten individuals with distinct roles, notably, the surgeon, who holds
the highest authority on all design, implementation, and testing decisions. The surgeon holds 
the most responsibility for the code, and as one skilled engineer is theorized to be able to 
realize the development of their project or project-component under one cohesive vision, unlike
teams lacking this hierarchy and clear separation of responsibilities. The author also theorizes
that an organization composed of teams with this structure should encounter less communication 
overhead (and scale better), since design decisions between teams need only be communicated from
one team's surgeon to another. 

The chapter does not investigate or analyze empirical results (so should be met with appropriate
skepticism), but the author does mention that a source "Baker's article" reports success on a 
small scale.

The ['project size and time allocation'](1661478052.md) zettel explains some of the troubles of 
attempting to scale up project productivity with more engineers.
