A **Proxy** server sits between your public IP (router) and the rest of the internet.
It may have several uses.

1. **Privacy** - by using a proxy server, your network's public IP address isn't exposed to the rest of the internet.
2. **Caching** - a proxy server may cache http responses, reducing latency.
3. **Monitoring** - a proxy server can log / monitor outgoing network traffic, thusgiving insight into where HTTP requests are being sent.
4. **Access Control** - a proxy server can restrict access / blacklist certain sites.
