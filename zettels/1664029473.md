There is no [deterministic approach](1662733779.md) to solving all 
software problems, and since we have to rely on heuristics, tools, and a bit of 
creative instinct, it's often true that the best solutions require tools and 
approaches unfamiliar to us. Furthermore, in a space where tools and approaches
are constantly evolving and improving, eclectic tendencies best take advantage
of these improvements.

Eclecticism is important for software development, that is, it is important to 
be willing to draw on a breadth of tools and approaches to solve softawre tasks.
