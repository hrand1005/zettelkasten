A prototype is a minimal amount of design and code created to answer simple or
specific questions, usually used during the design phase of a program or system.

Brooks distinguishes prototypes from incremental builds ([tracer bullets](1661985707.md)) 
by saying that they may be anything which reflects the design decisions of the 
conceptual model -- even a human hand behind the curtain simulating system responses
would suffice.

Hunt and Thomas in _The Pragmatic Programmer_, as well as McConnell in _Code Complete_
agree that prototypes must be disposable, and for coded prototypes, must be created
with their disposability and target questions in mind from the start.

From _The Pragmatic Programmer, Prototypes and Post-it Notes_:

_"Before you embark on any code-based prototyping, make sure that everyone 
understands that you are writing disposable code."_
