| Orchestration vs Choreography | 10/17/2023 00:24 |

**Orchestration** and **Choreography** are different architectural styles for
coordinating microservices.

In **orchestration** one central brain service ("orchestrator") coordinates
distributed behavior (eg transactions).

In **choreography** each microservice plays its own part in notifying other
microservices as required for distributed computing services.

|      | Orchestration                                                                | Choreography                                                              |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pros | + Explicit control over flows / transactions                                 | + Logic more evenly distributed among services                            |
|      | + Central access point for monitoring services                               | + Services are more loosely coupled (no central "God" service)            |
| Cons | - May result in imbalanced services (one "God" service)                      | - Additional work to monitor services                                     |
|      | - Services more tightly coupled/brittle due to integration with orchestrator | - Increased complexity to implement distributed rules for system behavior |
