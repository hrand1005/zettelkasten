Brooks recommends many readability practices for [user documentation](1665457120.md) 
(assumedly for developer-users) that corroborates advice in _Code Complete_, 
such as using meaningful variable names, emphasizing [control structure](1663016705.md) 
through layout, and [using meaningful comments](1663158405.md):

> _"So labels, declaration statements, and symbolic names are all harnessed to
the task of conveying as much meaning as possible to the reader. 
A second notion is to use space and format as much as possible to improve 
readability and show subordination and nesting.
The third notion is to insert the necessary prose documentation into the 
program as paragraphs of comment."_

Especially emphasized by Brooks is the 'prose' or paragraph comment for programs
and routines, which he says should not only describe function and purpose, but
also include detailed references to algorithms used and the literature which 
contains them. Furthermore the paragraphs should include changes, specializations,
and representations of the algorithms in question.

These kinds of references are somewhat similar to recommendations in 
["The Book Paradigm"](1663510511.md), although Brooks doesn't describe special
layouts for them.
