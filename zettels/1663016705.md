| Control Structure Layout | 09/12/2022 17:05 |

McConnell asserts that a primary consideration of layout is emphasizing logical
structure. He presents three valid styles of layout for control structures:

**Pure Block**
```
if (expression) {
  statement;
}
```

**Begin-End Pairs**
```
if (expression)
  {
  statement;
  }
```

**Endline**
```
if (expression) {
                statement;
                }
```

Notably, McConnell discourages the use of unindented curly braces in Begin-End
pairs, which is sometimes used in c++ and a standard for c#:
```
if (expression)
{
  statement;
}
```

McConnell states that this style does not emphasize logical structure, as the curly 
braces are neither part of the control statement (the opening curly brace is not on the
expression line) nor part of the subservient statement, as they are not indented.

Personally, I think there's a case for this style-- and it could be argued the curly braces 
are part of the control structure as in the pure block, but that the opening brace simply 
exists on a new line for clarity. Consider the following example with conventionally indented
multi-line control structures, both in pure block and c# style layouts:
```
if (expression 1) &&
  (expression 2) &&
  (expression 3) {
  statement;
}
```
In this case, the logical structure is obscured by the conventional approach to indenting multiple 
line control structure lines, which may sometimes be necessary for sufficiently large expressions.
However, the opening brace in the c# layout nicely demarcates the control structure from its nested
statement:
```
if (expression 1) &&
  (expression 2) &&
  (expression 3)
{
  statement;
}
```
