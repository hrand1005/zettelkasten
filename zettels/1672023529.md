| Go Goroutine Leak | 12/25/2022 21:58 |

A **goroutine leak** occurs when a goroutine doesn't terminate after it's no
longer needed. Goroutines aren't automatically collected by the garbage 
collector, so they must be managed properly -- leaked goroutines indicate a 
bug. 

For example, it is sometimes appropriate to use a buffered channel to execute 
concurrent queries in sveral goroutines, and use the first retrieved result
(See _The Go Programming Language_, Page 233 Code Sample). However, if an 
unbuffered channel were to be used in this instance, the [slower goroutines would
not terminate.](https://github.com/hrand1005/go-sandbox/blob/master/channels/leaked_goroutines/main.go)
