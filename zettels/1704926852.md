| Request-Response vs Event-based Collaboration | 01/10/2024 14:47 |

Independent services can communicate and collaborate in various ways.

**Request-Response** patterns look like synchronous calls between services.
Examples include HTTP REST (or other RESTful protocols) and RPC.

**Event-based** patterns model communication as events, and are typically
asynchronous. They usually involve some way to emit events, and some way to
consume events (or publish and subscribe to events).
Examples include RabbitMQ and Kafka.

| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Request-Response | + Simple to understand                                    | - Less intuitive to do things asynchronously                      |
| Event-based      | + Flexible and scalabe <br>+ Easy to model async services | - More complex, typically more processes involved (e.g. a broker) |
