| Go Brittle Tests | 03/06/2023 23:36 |

Some very strict assertions may cause tests to break over time as implementations
change. The authors recommend you avoid writing **brittle tests** that too strictly
compare outputs that may change in the future. If a function returns a string 
message, for example, it may be better to assert that it returns a certain 
_substring_ with `strings.Contains()` rather than using the `==` operator. 

One example that comes to my mind would be to check response headers and fields
in HTTP responses during [black box testing](1678163268.md) instead of the full
payload in the response body.
